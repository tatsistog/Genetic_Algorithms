  """ pick colors that are maximally perceptually distinct.
    
  Syntax:
  
    colors = selectColors(n_colors)
    colors = selectColors(n_colors,backgrounds=bg)
  
  Specify the number of colors you want as a scalar, n_colors. This will
  generate an n_colors-by-3 numpy array, each row representing an RGB
  color triple.
  
  The backgrounds option allows you to specify the background colors, 
  to make sure that your colors are also distinguishable from the colors
  specify in the n-by-3 numpy array each row representing an RGB color triple.
  Default value is np.array([[1,1,1],[0,0,0],[0.8,0.8,0.8],[1,0,1]]
  
  This function was inspired by the Matlab function select_colors 
  (or distinguishable_colors) from Timothy E. Holy.
